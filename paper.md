# Summary

We present `zELDA` (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman Alpha emitters), an open source code to model and fit Lyman-alpha (Lyα) line profiles. 
The main motivation is to provide the community with an easy to use and fast tool to analyse Lyα line profiles uniformly to improve the understating of Lyα emitting galaxies. 
In fiurst place, concerning the Lyα line modeling, `zELDA` is based on line profiles of the commonly used 'shell-model' pre-computed with the full Monte Carlo radiative transfer code LyaRT. 
Thus, `zELDA` provides a regular grid of 'shell-model' spectrum ranging expansion velocity from -1000 km/s to 1000 km/s, neutral hydrogen column density from $10^{17.0}cm^{-2}$ to $10^{21.5}cm^{-2}$, dust optical depth  from $10^{-4}$ to 1, intrinsic equivalent width from 0.1 to 1000 Ángstrom and intrinsic line width from 0.01 to 6.0 angstroms.This gives a total of  3,132,000 grid nodes. 
The line Lyα line profiles in an arbitray position inside the grid is compute via lineal interpolation. 
`zELDA` also include the algorithms to transform the ideal Lyα line profiles into realistic profiles mocking observations. 
In second place, the fitting of observed line profiles is handle with several methodologies. 
`zELDA` includes the fitting of Lyα line profiles obscured and unobscured by the intergalactic medium. 
Regarding the unobscured Lyα line profiles, `zELDA` includes an MCMC algotirhm powered by the python package EMCEE and two artificial neural netwrok models trained in mock spectrum. 
Regarding the IGM attenuated Lyα line profiles `zELDA` includes four artificial neural network models trained with the `zELDA` 'shell-model' grid and the IGM transmission curves from Byrohl 2020. 

# Statement of need

`Gala` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
